            <p class="text-[16px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Greentruth is designed to represent verified environmental
              attributes in a consistent, auditable format. To mint and verify
              QETs, we therefore process operational and MRV-related data such
              as facility or segment identifiers, basin or region, timestamps,
              emissions metrics, methodology references, and verifier
              identifiers.

            <p class="text-[16px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Where LCFS functionality is used, we may process additional
              compliance fields (including pathway codes, carbon intensity
              values, and verifier accreditation IDs). The platform is
              engineered so that token metadata and on-chain entries do not
              include Personal Data; they capture technical attributes needed
              for provenance and audit without identifying natural persons.
              Where applicable, MRV processing follows the QET Protocol that
              governs data collection, validation, and token lifecycle.

              Each customer organization is assigned enterprise wallets (and, if

              retire tokens. We keep records of these transactions to maintain
              chain-of-custody and support settlement or reporting. The
              blockchain layer stores non-identifying hashes and metadata only;
              Personal Data remains off-chain.

              Greentruth uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency and

              On-chain entries contain only non-identifying technical metadata
              such as token IDs, cryptographic hashes, and retirement
              references.

              To comply with GDPR erasure requirements, Earn implements a
              mapping key deletion process that ensures no residual identifiers
              remain after de-linking. This process includes permanent deletion
              of mapping keys from all operational databases and backups within
              90 days of a validated erasure request, verification logs
              maintained for 7 years to demonstrate compliance without retaining
              any linkable identifiers, and technical safeguards to prevent
              reconstruction of associations between on-chain metadata and
              off-chain Personal Data.
