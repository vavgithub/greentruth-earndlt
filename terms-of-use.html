              To access and use the Services, you will need to first register
              for an account (“Account”) to become a registered user
              (“Registered User”) as per the process described below or request
              access to transaction materials or Token information. The process
              to become a Registered User or otherwise requesting transaction
              materials or Token information may include you providing
              identification and qualification information.

              Unless separate and/or additional fees are mandated by another

              Token transfers will be subject to the then-current Platform
              transfer fees. Platform transfer fees will be paid by the Token
              transferor. When initiating an inter-organizational Token
              transfer, Earn will present you with a transfer fee statement for
              authorization within the Platform user interface. As Token
              transferor, you must authorize and pay the transfer fee prior to
              closing the transaction. You will be able to pay the transfer fees
              via credit card or ACH when authorizing the transaction.

              This Section 9 governs the disclosure of information to you in
              each and any data to which you are granted access for the purpose
              of verifying Token information or pursuing a transaction
              (“Transaction”) with the holder of a Token (the “Token Holder”),
              whether or not you have an Account. In connection with your
              consideration and evaluation of the Transaction, the Token Holder
              is prepared to make available to you certain information which is
              not available to the general public. All such information, whether
              written or oral, whether furnished on or after the date of this
              Agreement by the Token Holder, Earn, or their Representatives (as
              defined below), and regardless of the manner or form in which it
              is furnished, is collectively referred to in this Agreement as
              “Evaluation Material.” The obligations contained in this Section 9
              are in addition to any separate agreement between you and the
              Token Holder related to the topic matter contained herein.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[16px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You agree that the term “Evaluation Material” also means all
              notes, analyses, compilations, studies, or other documents or
              media generated by you or your Representatives in connection with
              the Transaction (“Created Material”) to the extent they contain,
              reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the confidential
              information furnished to you or your Representatives by the Token
              Holder, Earn or their Representatives pursuant to this Agreement.
              The term Evaluation Material does not include, however,
              information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the
              public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your
              Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (b) is or becomes
              available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential
              basis from a source (other than the Token Holder, Earn or any of
              their Representatives) which is not prohibited from disclosing
              such information to you by a legal, contractual or fiduciary
              obligation to the Token Holder, (c) was or is in your possession
              prior to disclosure by the Token Holder, Earn or their
              Representatives, and (d) was or is independently developed by you
              or your Representatives or on your respective behalves without
              violating the terms of this Agreement. The term “Representatives”
              means, as to any Person, its directors, officers, employees,
              agents, advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys,
              accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisors and each of
              their representatives); provided, that for purposes of this
              Agreement, none of such Persons shall be deemed a Representative
              hereunder, nor shall you have any liability for such Person,
              unless such Person has been furnished by you or by us with
              Evaluation Material hereunder. The term “Person” as used in this
              Agreement is broadly interpreted to include any corporation,
              company, partnership or other legal or business entity or any
              individual.

                after compliance with paragraph 2 below), unless otherwise
                agreed to in writing by the Token Holder, you will (a) not use
                the Evaluation Material for any purpose other than in connection
                with your evaluation, negotiation and/or consummation of the
                Transaction, (b) keep the Evaluation Material confidential and
                not disclose any Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever
                except as provided herein and (c) not distribute, disseminate,

                You will direct your Representatives to observe the terms of

                this Agreement by your Representatives of the terms applicable
                to them. The term “Law” means any applicable law or regulation

                If you or any of your Representatives are requested pursuant to,
                or required by, Law to disclose any Evaluation Material
                concerning the Token Holder or the Transaction, you will use

                such request or requirement to the extent legally permissible
                and reasonably practicable, so that the Token Holder may seek,

                appropriate remedy, or in the Token Holder’s sole discretion,
                waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If no such

                Token Holder waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement,
                you or your Representatives will disclose only that portion of

                required to be disclosed and will use commercially reasonable
                efforts to ensure any such information so disclosed will be
                accorded confidential treatment.

                you or your Representatives to the extent such copies do not
                contain Created Material), either return to the Token Holder or
                at your sole discretion destroy, all hard copies and electronic

              at the time the arbitration is initiated (collectively referred to
              as the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement,

              is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration
              Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control
              unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
              inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
              fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow
              the provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including
              without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in
              Section 17.

              17.7. For new Earn users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no
              later than 30 Days after the date you use our Website or Services
              for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Earn,
              Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 85 Broad Street, 16th Floor, New
              York, NY. 10004. Notice must state that you do not agree to the
              Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone
              number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Earn
              account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out
              Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you
              can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the
              Arbitration Agreement, Earn will likewise not be bound by these
              arbitration provisions. All other terms of this Agreement will

              effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements
              that you may have with us. Earn users who accepted a previous
              version of this Agreement that included an arbitration agreement,
              and who did not timely opt out of that arbitration agreement,
              remain bound by the last arbitration agreement that they accepted.
              Upon receipt of a valid Opt-Out Notice, Earn will provide the
              opting out user with a copy of the arbitration agreement from the
              last version of the Agreement that the user accepted, if any
